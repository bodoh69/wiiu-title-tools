# Wii U Title Tools

A tool to display the contents of
`/storage_slc/rights/sys/title.list`

Basically, just show whatever applications are installed.
For now, the `title.list` file needs to be in your working
directory wherever you run this program.

Usage:

`java -jar /path/to/WiiUTitleTools.jar`
